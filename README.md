# Digital Humanities 140 - Coding for Humanities
## Student Information
Hello! My name is Mark Andal, and I am a 4th year computer engineering student at UCLA. My interests lie in integrating software and hardware into emerging technology systems, like the internet-of-things. I aspire to be at the forefront of technology and to push the definition of what it means to be connected.
I am taking this class for credit towards my technical breadth, digital humanities.

## Course Description
Digital Humanities 140 (DH140 for short) teaches Python with a humanistic lens and perspective. Learning libraries such as nltk for text analysis, to pandas and matplotlib for data visualizations, this class bridges the gap between technology and humanities research, with a focus on data science.

## Project Ideas
Some project ideas / topics of interest that would be fun to potentially explore:
* Social media data
* Pop culture data

## Objectives
As I do have coding experience being a computer engineering student, my main objectives revolve around challenging myself with Python to gain a broader depth with the libraries we will learning as well as getting a better understanding and appreciation of digital humanities research. I aim to create a well-constructed narrative from the data I select and analyze, presenting the information and my ideas in a clear, thoughtful manner.
